This is an example of what the TLLibrary can do.

Set up a project with SFML installed, then copy the below code into a new C++ project. Compile.
Note, this code will only work on Debian series Linux OSes. It can be modified for Windows but that's down to you.

Once compiled, example program should generate randomised images based on algorithms.

The algorithms, images etc are all free to use. Feel free to create your own algorithms and modify the example code for
your own purposes.

One recommended use for the graphics is tilesets for a game.

You can also increase the resolution of an image, however this increases the time it takes to render an image.

It will overwrite pre-existing files with the same name without prompt or warning, so use with catuious.
